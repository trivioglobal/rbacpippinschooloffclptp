Table Count Summary

Based on the list you provided:

Type

Count

Regular Tables

97

Views (prefixed with v_)

17

Total

114

Note:

3 of those tables are PostGIS system tables (not your application tables):
geography_columns
geometry_columns
spatial_ref_sys
So if you're counting only your application tables: 94 tables + 17 views = 111 total

Academics (Classes, Subjects, Timetables, Examinations)
Fees & Payments
Communication (SMS, Email, WhatsApp, Push Notifications)
